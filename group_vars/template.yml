    # so that each size item is applied to each server
    # eg. 
    # quantity: 4
    # custom_size: # notice that there are 4 sizes
    #   - s-1vcpu-1gb
    #   - s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb

    #   - s-1vcpu-2gb
    # [optional|default:['s-1vcpu-1gb']]
    custom_size: ['s-1vcpu-1gb'] # 
    # if the list is smaller than the quantity, then the remaining
    # servers will be sized using the last item in the list.

    # This is mandatory and will be used to configure the volumes for microcloud
    # the concept is similar to custom_size. Specify 1 or specify as much
    # as the quantity you have specified
    # it must be an integer (represents Gigabyte)
